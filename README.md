Task List App
This is a simple and intuitive task management application built with React, offering a clean user interface powered by Tailwind CSS. It helps you keep track of your daily tasks efficiently.

Features
View Tasks: See a list of all your current tasks.

Add New Tasks: Easily add new items to your to-do list.

Mark as Completed: Toggle tasks as complete or incomplete. Completed tasks are visually distinct.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need.

Input Validation: Prevents you from adding empty tasks.

Technologies Used
React: For building the dynamic user interface.

Tailwind CSS: For efficient and highly customizable styling.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_LINK_HERE]
cd [YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME]

(Remember to replace [YOUR_REPOSITORY_LINK_HERE] and [YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME] with your actual repository URL and the folder name it creates.)

Install dependencies:

npm install

Running the Application
Once dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

npm run dev
# or, if using create-react-app setup:
npm start

This command typically opens the application in your web browser at http://localhost:5173 (or http://localhost:3000).

Usage
Add a Task: Type your task into the input field and either click "Add Task" or press Enter.

Complete/Uncomplete a Task: Click on a task's text or its checkbox to mark it as complete or incomplete.

Delete a Task: Click the trash can icon next to a task to remove it from your list.

Potential Enhancements
Filtering: Add options to filter tasks (e.g., show only completed or pending tasks).

Persistence: Integrate a backend or local storage to save tasks across browser sessions.# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
